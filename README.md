1. [C - Variables, if, else, while](./Project_1_variables_if_else_while/) :

    - What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
    - What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
    - What the the relational operators and how to use them
    - What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
    - What are the boolean operators and how to use them

    - How to use comments
    - How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
    - How to assign values to variables
    - How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf

    - How to use variables with the while loop
    - How to print variables using printf
    - What is the ASCII character set
    - What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64


2. [C - Functions, nested loops](./Project_2_functions_nested_loops/) :

    - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    - All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
    - All your files should end with a new line
    - A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
    - Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    - You are not allowed to use global variables
    - No more than 5 functions per file
    - You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
    - You are allowed to use _putchar
    - You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
    - In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
    - The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
    - Don’t forget to push your header file

    - What are nested loops and how to use them
    - What is a function and how do you use functions
    - What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
    - What is a prototype
    - Scope of variables
    - What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
    - What are header files and how to to use them with #include
