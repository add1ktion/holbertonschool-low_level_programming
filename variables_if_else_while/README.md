# Variables If Else While

1. **[Task 0](.//0-positive_or_negative.c)** - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
2. **[Task 1](./1-last_digit.c)** - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
3. **[Task 2](./2-print_alphabet.c)** - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
4. **[Task 3](./3-print_alphabets.c)** - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
5. **[Task 4](./4-print_alphabt.c)** - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
6. **[Task 5](./5-print_numbers.c)** - Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
