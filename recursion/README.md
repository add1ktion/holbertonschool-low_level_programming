# C - Recursions

- **[0-puts_recursion.c](./0-puts_recursion.c)** - Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
  _puts_recursion prints a string by calling itself on the next character until it reaches the end of the string.
It’s a great example for understanding the recursion call stack in C: each character is handled in a separate function call, and the function finishes by unwinding back through the previous calls once the end of the string is reached.

- **[1-print_rev_recursion.c](./1-print_rev_recursion.c)** - Write a function that prints a string in reverse.

- **[2-strlen_recursion.c](./2-strlen_recursion.c)** - Write a function that returns the length of a string.

- **[3-factorial.c](./3-factorial.c)** - Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

- **[4-pow_recursion.c](./4-pow_recursion.c)** - Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

- **[5-sqrt_recursion.c](./5-sqrt_recursion.c)** - Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.tters of a string to uppercase.

- **[6-is_prime_number.c](./6-is_prime_number.c)** - Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

- **[100-is_palindrome.c](./100-is_palindrome.c)** - Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

- **[101-wildcmp.c](./101-wildcmp.c)** - Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
